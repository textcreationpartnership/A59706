            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But in theſe daies they are become almoſt as natural to men, as their language and diſcourſe; and therefore the diſeaſe, ſo deeply rooted, and over-ſpreading, calls for the application of the Remedy, which our Law doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly furniſh us withall. And hence it is, I have been encouraged to ingage in this work; which
<pb facs="tcp:47134:4"/> is nothing elſe but a naked and Methodical Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the remedies preſcribed by the Law againſt this Malady. And herein (for brevity ſake) you may finde in ſome Rules in the firſt, and in ſome (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſome of the laſt) Examples anſwering to thoſe Rules; in the laſt Chapter of the Book, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of the whole work. Wherein we have thought it beſt to name (amongſt others of more Authority) ſome of the Caſes in the Books of uncertain Authors lately publiſhed, and leave the ſame to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reader. You may, perhaps, finde herein ſome ſeeming Impertinencies, Superfluities, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and vain Repetitions, the which upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deliberation will bee found otherwiſe. And there will bee, doubtleſs, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of time, and haſte of the Preſs, many Erratas of mine and the Printers eſcaped. But this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I doubt not, but it may bee found very uſefull to the ends I have propoſed to my ſelf therein, <hi>viz.</hi> For Lawyers, to lead them to the Caſes, that they ſhall have occaſion to look after therein. For others, to teach them to ſet a watch before the door of their Lips. And if now you will but cover the Defects of the work, and accept of the pains of the Author, this is all that is deſired by your Friend, a lover of his Country, and well wiſher to the Laws thereof.</p>

This alſo is either of great men, called <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> or it is of <note place="margin">Scandalum Magnatum.</note> ordinary men. The Action of the Caſe for déeds, is either upon an <hi>Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> or Promiſe, or upon a Nuſance, upon a Trover and Converſion, upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47134:6"/> a Deceit, upon a Conſpiracy, or it is upon ſome other Non-feaſance, or Miſ-feaſance. Amongſt Slanders and Defamations, alſo ſome of them <note place="margin">For Words and Acts of Slander.</note> tend to the diſgrace of the perſon of another: Some to the diſgrace of the Title of his Land. Thoſe againſt the perſon alſo, do ſome of them tend to the peril of his life; ſome to the prejudice of a man in his Livelihood and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ſome to his reproach in his Name only. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 92, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>A Defamation may be alſo by déeds, as by the doing of ſomething againſt a man, which will be Tant-amount, or more than a Slander by words, as to call a man in queſtion, and proſecute a man in a courſe of Juſtice, for a ſuppoſed Crime, whereof he is innocent, bringing of an Action, &amp;c. <hi>Bulſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Part.</hi> 272. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 14, 15.

               <p>Some Defamations alſo may be ſaid to be temporal or civil; as to call one Traitor, Murderer, Théef, Bankrupt, and the like.</p>
               <p>Some ſpiritual, as to call one Adulterer, Baud, Whore, Heretick, and the like.</p>

               <p>WEE ſhall firſt give you in ſundry Rules, and a few Caſes, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> general Doctrine of Actions of the Caſe touching Slanders; And theſe like the veins in the body run through the body of all the Caſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after following, wherein the words are, or are not actionable, as they fall within theſe Rules. And then wée ſhall give you the Caſes themſelves as examples anſwering to theſe Rules. The Rules are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. That all ſcandalous words which touch or concern a man in his life, as to ſay hée is a Traitor, Théef, or the like; or which touch him in his Liberty, as heretofore to have ſaid of one, Hée was Villain to <hi>J. S.</hi> or which concern a man in member in any corporal puniſhment, as to ſay, A man hath ſtoln ſix-pence (which is <hi>Petit Larceny)</hi> or the like: or which <note place="margin">Theft.</note> ſcandal a man in his office, or place of Truſt, as to ſay to a Iudge or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace, Hée is a corrupt Iudge or Iuſtice of Peace, or the like; Or <note place="margin">Corruption in an office. Deceit in Trade</note> which ſlander a man in his Calling or Trade, by whith hée gets his living, as to ſay to an Attorney, You are a cheating Knave, of a Trades-man, that lives by buying and ſelling, hée is a Bankrupt, or the like; or which tend to the loſſe of a mans preferment, as to ſay to a man about to be preferred to a Benefice, That hée is an Heretick; or of a woman like to have a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <note place="margin">Heretick. Whore. Infectious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> that ſhée is a Whore; or the like, if by this means they loſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; or which charge a man to have any dangerous diſeaſe, by reaſon whereof hée ought to ſeparate himſelf, or be ſeparated by the Law from the ſociety of men, as to ſay a man hath the <hi>French-Pox:</hi> or the Plague, or the like, or which tend to the ſlandering of a mans Title, as to ſay, Hée hath no Eſtate in his Mannor, when hée is about, and hath néed to ſell it, or the like: Or which tend to a mans diſ-inheritance; as to ſay to an Heir to Land, Hée is a Baſtard, or the like: Or which tend any other way to the <note place="margin">Baſtardy.</note> infamy, diſcredit, or diſgrace of a man; or that may any way import any damage to a man. All ſuch words regularly are Actionable, <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>&amp;c.

This General Rule for the clearing of it, doth admit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Extenſions, and many Exceptions and Limitations, which wée ſhall lay down in the Rules that follow. The Rules of Extenſion may be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That albeit ſome of the words ſpoken at the ſame time are, and others <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Some words Actionable, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not. Sect.</hi> 2.</note> of them are not Actionable, yet an Action may lye for the Actionable words, and the Action may be brought for them altogether. <hi>Dyer.</hi> 75. <hi>Plow.</hi> 118. <hi>Trin.</hi> 8. <hi>Jac. B. R. Lukers Caſe. Jenk. Cent.</hi> 7. <hi>Caſe</hi> 70. <hi>Coo.</hi> 10. 131. <hi>Styles</hi> 112.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That many words (though of themſelves they be not Actionable) yet <note place="margin">Words aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to Action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words.</note> being equivalent to words that are Actionable, may bear an Action; for they may <hi>prima facie,</hi> ſound from the mouth of the ſpeaker, in the ears of the hearer, as bad as any Actionable words. <hi>Paſche.</hi> 15. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B. R.</hi> Agréed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it matters not how the words (if they be Actionable) be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <note place="margin">Which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever publiſhed.</note> or divulged, whether by writing, or ſpéech; for the Action is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in both Caſes.

See in <hi>Huttons Rep.</hi> 10. In <hi>Owens Rep.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is all one as to the maintainance of the Action, if the words <note place="margin">Spoken to, or of a man all one.</note>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47134:7"/> be ſpoken or written to the perſon ſlandered before his face, or of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his back, Old Book of Entries. <hi>Coo</hi> 4. 14. 15. and <hi>Hob. P.</hi> 292.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it is not material whether the words be ſpoken in the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Spoken in the ſecond or third perſon, all one. Theft.</note> to the party ſlandered himſelf, as thus. Thou art, or you are a Théef, or in the third perſon behinde his back, thus; <hi>J. S.</hi> is a Théef, for the Action is alike maintainable in both Caſes. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor is it material in what language the words are written or ſpoken, <note place="margin">Words written or ſpoken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> whether in <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>Welch,</hi> or in the Native Language, they be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in all, if they be ſpoken ſo as the hearers do, or may attain to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of them. And yet if the words in their Native Language be ſuch as are not Actionable, no Action will lye for them; And if in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language in the hearing of them that do not underſtand them, it ſéems they are not Actionable; And yet if one ſpeak words in another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that are Actionable, and hée Engliſh them himſelf by words that are not Actionable, it is ſaid, the words ſhall not bear Action. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Spoken after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of Speech. Sect.</hi> 3.

               <p>That actionable words in all caſes (eſpecially in caſes where they may bring a man in dauger of his life, muſt have theſe qualifications and conditions in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt be falſe, for if the thing ſpoken be true, let the words bée what they will, the party that ſpeaks them may juſtifie them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47134:9"/> 2. They muſt be malicious, and purpoſely; and intentionally to ſlander and defame, for otherwiſe notwithſtanding they be true, yet will they not be actionable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt be particular and clear, for if they be ſo general, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be ambiguous and doubtful, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt bée of a ſimple, ſingle, and known ſenſe; for if they be of an indifferent meaning, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They muſt be certain, againſt which there may not be any intendment; for if they be altogether uncertain, either as to the perſon ſlandered, or the ſlander it ſelf, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The words muſt have in them ſome matter of weight and ſubſtance; for if the things ſpoken import no ſubſtantial matter, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They muſt be poſitive, affirmative, and direct, importing ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Accuſation; for if they import a ſlander by way of Argument, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or Implication only, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They muſt import a thing poſſible to bée; for if they import a thing ſimply and apparently impoſſible, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They muſt import ſome Act done; for if they import only an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Inclination, or Intention to do ſomething, and nothing done, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They muſt carry in them, or cauſe by occaſion of them ſomething of damage and prejudice to him againſt whom they are ſpoken; for if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, they neither do, nor will bring any damage to him, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The words all of them ſpoken together muſt be actionable; for if ſome of them only be actionable, and the reſt ſpoken at the ſame time do qualifie them, and take away the force thereof, no Action will lye upon them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They muſt be ſpoken in an extrajudicial way; for if they be ſpoken in a courſe of Iuſtice, and a judicial way, no Action will lye upon them.</p>

               <p n="2">2. For the ſecond thing; The words ſpoken muſt be malicious, and with <note place="margin">The words muſt be malicious.</note> an intent and purpoſe to prejudice him againſt whom they are ſpoken; For the Writ is <hi>falſo &amp; malitioſe,</hi> and it muſt be both falſe and malitious, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is not good, it is therefore in this conſiderable <hi>Quo Animo.</hi> The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47134:10"/> words therefore muſt be ſuch, as importing ſomething, that if true, may bring the party againſt whom they are ſpoken, in danger for his Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Eſtate, or Credit, and no good cauſe can be ſhewed for the ſpeaking of them. But for the diſcovery of the malice, theſe things are to bée known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That where no other Cauſe can be ſhewed of the ſpeaking of the words; there the Law will take it to be malicious. That which is chiefly therefore to be conſidered, is <hi>Cauſa Dicendi.</hi> For if a Lawyer ſhall in the pleading of his Clients cauſe, innocently, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the cauſe in hand (which hée muſt look to) and according to his Inſtructions, ſpeak ſuch words as may charge a man with a Crime, or bée actionable in another Caſe; this ſhall not be taken to be malicious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not actionable. And yet if the Lawyer ſhall ſpeak thoſe words at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, or in another place then when and where the Cauſe is debated; this may be actionable. So where a Preacher in preaching ſhall recite a Hiſtory out of a Book, that doth prove falſe and ſcandalous; this will not be actionable. So if one adviſe his friend to forbear the Company of ſuch a one, for that ſhée hath the Pox, or tell his friend of ſomewhat that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, and wiſh him to clear himſelf of it; In theſe Caſes no Action will lye, for theſe words. For here the cauſe, or occaſion of the ſpeaking of the words, doth ſhew, that there was no malicious intent in the ſpeaker when hée ſpake the words. And yet if one ſhall make this but a Cloak for his malice in any ſuch Caſe as this, it will be otherwiſe. But by theſe and ſuch like Circumſtances, it muſt be conſidered, with what mind hée ſpake the words, and whether there were malice in them, or not. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 148. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B.

               <p n="3">3. For the third thing, The words ſpoken muſt be clear and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <note place="margin">The words muſt be clear and perſpicuous</note> as, <hi>Thou art a Theef, J.

               <p n="4">4. For the fourth thing; They muſt be of a ſimple, ſingle, and univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <note place="margin">The words muſt be of a plain and ſimple ſenſe, or univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> ſenſe in the vulgar acceptance of them: As, <hi>Thou didſt burn the Barn of J.

               <p>For if they be of a double and indifferent ſenſe, that may be taken one <note place="margin">Words of a double ſenſe, or equivocal.</note> way or other; there if the words taken in either ſenſe be actionable, they muſt néeds give an Action. But if the words will bear a good, and a bad ſenſe, or a worſe, and better ſenſe; there if there be nothing in the Caſe by that which is ſaid with them, and before, or after them, to guide them more to the worſer, than to the better ſenſe, they ſhall be alwaies taken in the better, and not in the worſer ſenſe, and ſo not be liable to Action. For in this the Rule is, <hi>verba ſunt accipienda in mitiori ſenſu.</hi> And again, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignior</hi>

Felony.</note> That no Action will lye, for ſaying of a man, <hi>Hee did burn my Barn,</hi> for it may be a Barn without Corn; Nor for ſaying, <hi>Hee hath the Pox;</hi> for it may be the ordinary, not the <hi>French-Pox;</hi> Nor for ſaying, <hi>Thou art a Coyner of Gold;</hi> for it may be his Trade, and hee may do it by authority; Nor for this, <hi>I charge you with Felony,</hi> for this may be ſuch a Felony, as for which damages only are recoverable as a Maihm is: Nor for this, <hi>Thou</hi>

And no <hi>Invendo</hi> in any of theſe Caſes will make any ſuch like words that in themſelves are not actionable to bée actionable. And yet if in this Caſe, the Common, Ordinary, and Violent ſenſe of the words in the Import thereof be the worſe ſenſe; and there bée no other words ſpoken with them to turn their ſenſe the other way, there they may be taken in the worſer ſenſe, and liable to Action; and therefore it hath béen adiudged to lye for theſe words, <hi>A. hath had the uſe of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>

                     <hi>The words muſt be direct and certain as to the perſon and thing. Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Theft.</hi>
                  </note> muſt be ſo apparent, direct, and certain, that there may be no intendment againſt them; as <hi>J. S. is a Theef;</hi> or, <hi>your Husband,</hi> or, <hi>your Wife,</hi> or, <hi>your Father is a Theef.</hi> For if they be altogether uncertain, either as to the perſon ſlandered, or as to the ſlander it ſelf, no Action will lye upon them. And therefore if one ſay, <hi>One that is neer you is a Theef,</hi> or, <hi>mine enemy is a Theef;</hi> or, <hi>one of the Sons</hi> [or, <hi>one of the Servants] of J. S.</hi> (who hath many Sons or Servants) <hi>is a Theef,</hi> or the like; no Action will lye for theſe words. And ſo if one ſay, <hi>A. deſerves to be hanged;</hi> Or, <hi>A.</hi>

                  <hi>hath taken away money from J. S.</hi> or, <hi>A. ſeeks my life;</hi> or, <hi>A. hath a mind to kill mee;</hi> or, <hi>A. ſmells of the murther of J.

And no <hi>Invendo</hi> can in theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">Invendo.</note> make the words certain and actionable. And yet if there be any thing elſe ſpoken in the conference, by which there is a certain deſcription of the perſon ſlandered, as where the conference is about ſuch a Son or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by name, and therein the party ſay, <hi>Hee is a Theef,</hi> or by which the <note place="margin">Theft.</note> thing intended by the ſlander is cleared, this may make the words cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſo actionable. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Hobb.

               <p>For the ſixth thing, That the words ſpoken muſt have in them ſome matter of weight and ſubſtance; and therefore the Law will not give this Action for every light and trivial ſpéech, nor for every paſſionate word or ſpéech, but there muſt be ſome ſuch weighty and ſubſtantial matter in the words, that if true, might be perilous, and prejudicial to the party of whom they are ſpoken. And therefore it is agréed, That this Action will not lye, for any of theſe following words; <hi>Thou art a Villain, Rogue, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Villain, Rogue. Varlet. Raſcal. Knave. Couzener. Cheater. Railer. Miſcreant. Hypocrite.</note>

And yet any of theſe words being joyned with other words that are action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, may aggravate the ſlander, and ſo increaſe the damages. So to ſay of another, <hi>That hee keeps ſuch a Dogg, that his neighbours Cattel about him cannot go in peace;</hi> or, <hi>that his Cattel are in every mans ground.</hi> For theſe, and ſuch like words as theſe, no Action will lye.

               <p>For the ſeventh thing, That the words (eſpecially if they concern a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47134:11"/> man in his life) muſt be ſo particular, poſitive, affirmative, and direct, that they may import a peremptory Accuſation. And not by way of Argument, Inference, or Implication only, for if they ſo import a ſlander only, no Action will lye upon them. And therefore it is agréed, that no Action will lye for <note place="margin">Felony.</note> words thus ſpoken; <hi>I fear you will be charged with Felony;</hi> or, <hi>take heed you be not arreſted for Felony,</hi> or, <hi>I doubt whether your words may not be treaſonable words;</hi> or, <hi>thou haſt deſerved to be hanged for Felony;</hi>

               <p>For the eighth thing, That the thing ſaid by the words, muſt be a thing that is poſſible to have béen done. For if it import ſuch a thing done, as is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and apparently impoſſible, no Action will lye upon them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is held, that no Action will lye for ſaying of another, <hi>that hee hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Murther.</note> 
                  <hi>killed my Wife,</hi> for that the words themſelves do ſhew her to be then alive. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16. So to ſay to a Brewer, <hi>My Mare doth piſs as good Beer as thou doſt brew,</hi> theſe words in themſelves are impoſſible, and will bear no Action.

               </p>
               <p>For the ninth thing, That the words muſt import ſome Act done. For if <note place="margin">Not for words importing only an inclination or intention to do a thing. Adjective words.</note> they import only an Inclination, Affection, or Intention to do a thing, no Action will lye upon them. And therefore it is held, That no Action will lye for ſuch like words as theſe; <hi>Hee is a Theeviſh Knave;</hi> or, <hi>hee is a Traiterous Knave;</hi> or, <hi>hee is a ſeditious Knave.</hi> And yet if theſe, and ſuch like Adjective words, ſhall import an Act done; as, <hi>Hee is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Knave;</hi> or the like; There this Action will lye, Or if they be <note place="margin">Theft.</note> ſuch words as do ſlander a man in his Office, Function, or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as to ſay of a Judge. <hi>Hee is a corrupt Judge;</hi> or, of ſuch an Officer, <note place="margin">Corruption in an officer.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee is a corrupt Officer;</hi> or, <hi>hee is a bribing Knave:</hi> Or if they be ſuch words as do ſlander a man in his Trade; As to ſay of a Tradeſman, <hi>Hee is a Bankrupt [or a Bankeruptly] fellow.</hi> For all theſe, and ſuch like <note place="margin">Bankerupt.</note> words the Action will lye.

As, <hi>Hee would have robbed mee, and did rob mee of my dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> And ſo alſo it will lye where the words import that hée is doing of the Act, as where hée ſaith of one, <hi>Hee is raviſhing a woman,</hi> or, <hi>hee is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a man; Coo.</hi> 4. 16, 19. <hi>Hobb.

For if the thing ſpoken being true, may not hinder, or hurt him by hazard of his life, or by the infringing of his Liberty, or by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of his eſtate, or by the defamation of his Credit, no Action will lye upon them. And therefore it is agréed, That to charge a man with a Crime by words in another language, that none of the hearers underſtand, or to charge a man in an Action brought with the killing of a man, where it doth appear by the Record it ſelf, that the party ſuppoſed to be killed, is yet alive, is not actionable; for hée neither hath, nor can have damage by it. So to charge a man with a trivial light matter, as that hee hath erected a Cottage againſt the Law, or hath a Dog that will not ſuffer his neighbours

               <p>For the eleventh thing, That the words all of them ſpoken together <note place="margin">That the words muſt be taken altogether.</note> muſt be Actionable, for words that are in, and of themſelves Actionable, may be qualified by the precedent, or ſubſequent words joyned with them, and ſpoken at the ſame time, and therefore where part of the words rent aſunder from the reſt are Actionable; but there are other words ſpoken before, or after them at the ſame time, and in the ſame ſpeech, or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that doe explain, limit, and qualifie them, in ſuch caſes they will not be Actionable; and therefore it is agréed, that no Action will lye for the words in the Caſes hereafter following. <hi>For that thou haſt ſtoln my Apple, out of my Orchard, I will ſay thou art a Theef;</hi> or, <hi>Art thou not a Theef that haſt ſtoln away my Evidences;</hi> or, <hi>Art not thou a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that haſt killed ſo many Hares?</hi> Or, where two are talking of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and one of them ſhall brag how many Hares he had killed by Engines, and thereupon the other ſay to him, <hi>Thou art a Murtherer,</hi> in theſe and ſuch like caſes no Action will lye upon them. But theſe two Rules are given herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the words that ſhall qualifie and extenuate ſuch Actionable words, muſt be full and clear, and not ambiguous.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the words that muſt qualifie and correct, muſt be ſuch as doe not contain any matter of ſlander in them.</p>
               <p>And 3 Some make a queſtion of ſuch kind of words, where they are ſubſequent to the Actionable words, and are brought in by the word <hi>(And) as you are a Theef, and you have ſtoln my Apples out of my Orchard;</hi> and in this caſe they argue that they are additional, and cumulative, and ſhall not correct at all, as they ſhall when they are brought in by the word <hi>For, as you are a Theef, for you have ſtoln my Apples, &amp;c.</hi> But ſée more of this hereafter. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Hobb.

               <p>For the twelfth thing. That the words muſt be ſpoken in an extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial <note place="margin">That the words be not divulged in a courſe of Juſtice,</note> way, for if a ſlander ſhall be raiſed and ſpread only by occaſion, and the means of a proſecution, by one that doth but purſue the courſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in an ordinary way of Iuſtice, no Action will lye for this, for in this it is held for a rule, That for a Suit, or any other legal procéeding in a courſe of Juſtice, if it be not out of malice, and touch not a mans life, no Action will lye; and therefore this Action will not lye againſt a man for bringing a <hi>Writ of Forger of falſe Deeds,</hi> nor for preferring Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Forgery.</note> a man to a Iuſtice of Peace to have the good behaviour againſt him, nor for the proſecution of a ſuſpected Felon, by indictment as there is cauſe; and yet if in this caſe the proſecution ſhall prove to be malicious, as where an Indictment is preferred againſt a man for Felony, or the like, and there be not ſo much as <hi>probabilis cauſa</hi> for what is done, and the party be acquited upon it; he may have this Action, or an Action in the nature of a Conſpiracy; for as a Thief may be ſpared by the favour of Iurors, ſo <note place="margin">Conſpiracy.</note> an honeſt man may be much prejudiced in his reputation by ſuch a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proſecution, 41, 42. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>For the thirtéenth thing, That the words muſt be ſpoken in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome body that doth underſtand them, for if words of ſlander be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Latine, Gréek, Welch, or any other Language in the hearing of ſuch perſons, as whereof not one amongſt them doth underſtand what they <note place="margin">Words of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language.</note> intend, or ſignifie; no Action will lye upon them. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. 65. 144. <hi>Hobb.

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47134:12"/>
               <p> For the fourtéenth thing, That where a man is charged with a Crime by any ſuch words, and it doth not appear, that he had notice of the ground or occaſion of the Crime, in this caſe no Action will lye for the words; As where one is charged to kéep Théeves about him, and it is not ſaid that he knew them to be ſuch, no Action will lye for this, <hi>Mich</hi> 40. 41. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

               <p>And thus much for the Rules of Limitation, or Exception.</p>
               <p>The Rules that follow are of another nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That if a man be charged with a Felony by a common fame, Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Impriſoned, or Indicted upon it, and yet be (as he may be) innocent, he may not upon this ground be charged with this Felony, and therefore if any man in this caſe ſhall charge him with it, he way by this make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liable to this Action, for in this caſe common fame will not excuſe him that ſhall ſo charge him for this ſlander. <hi>Brownl.

               <p n="2">2 That if the words ſpoken be true, let them be what they will, the Defendant may juſtifie them, and excuſe himſelf; <hi>Broo. Action of the Caſe,</hi> 104.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That in ſome caſes, the words that are in their firſt utterance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly and incertainly ſpoken, and perhaps not Actionable, that theſe words may yet by the pleadings of the Parties, and Verdict of a Iury for the Plaintiff be made certain, and ſo become Actionable. The Pleadings therefore of the parties in theſe Suits muſt be carefully héeded, for they may be of great advantage or diſadvantage to either party.</p>
               <p>4 That words relating to a Perſon ought to be underſtood according to the condition of the perſon to whom they are ſpoken; ſo that the ſame words ſpoken to ſome meaner men, that will not bear an Action, yet ſpoken to a more eminent perſon may be Actionable, <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. laſt publiſht, 192, 193. As to ſay to a Biſhop, or a Iudge, or Iuſtice of the Peace, or the like man, he is a Vermine in the Common-wealth, or a corrupt man, may be Action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

               </p>
               <p>For the better diſcovery, and more clear underſtanding of general am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous and uncertain words, and when they are, or are not actionable, theſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.</note> things are to be known.</p>
               <p>That the intent and meaning of the Speaker in them is as well to bée héeded (as far as it can be known) as the import of the words themſelves. And for this it is ſaid, It muſt bée héeded, <hi>Quo Animo,</hi> they are ſpoken, <hi>&amp; ſenſus verborum eſt attendendus. Et quae ad unum ſenſum</hi> [or, <hi>ad unum finem] loquuta ſunt non debent ad alium detor queri.</hi> Nor are theſe Actions to be maintained upon mens words by a ſtrained Conſtruction; but where the words in themſelves do import a ſlander. And for the better finding out of the ſenſe of mens words, and their intent in them, this is to be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That words are not to be taken and underſtood in a ſtrict and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe, or <hi>ex ei termini per ſe,</hi> in their natural and proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but in the vulgar and common ſenſe that they are taken in the time when, and the place where they are ſpoken. For in this the Rule is <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum ut vulgus. Intelligendum ut ſapiens.</hi> And hence it is that the ſame words that in one Country are actionable, in another Country are not actionable. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are not to be carried by a forrein Conſtruction beſides their moſt natural likely, and common ſenſe and meaning, into another ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. 352.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The cauſe, or occaſion of the ſpeaking of them is to be conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                     </gap>ius ex cauſa dicendi.</hi> For upon this difference it is, That the ſame words that will bear an Action in one caſe, will not bear an Action in another caſe. And words that in themſelves will bear an Action, yet conſidered <hi>ex cauſa dicendi,</hi> will not bear an Action. And therefore if one ſay of another, <hi>That hee is a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Baſtardy.</note> when this is to defend his own title, where he himſelf doth claim to be heir to the Land, that is now in queſtion, or like to be in queſtion.

               <p n="4">4. The words muſt be conſidered by all the reſt of the words ſpoken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them at the ſame time. And they are to be taken <hi>ſecundum ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectam materiam, &amp; conjunctim uno halitu,</hi> and not by a part of them rent aſunder from the reſt: And therefore if one be talking about a Iudge, Attorney; or other ſuch like Officer about his office, and in this diſcourſe ſay, <hi>Hee is known to be a corrupt man, and to deal corruptly;</hi> this will <note place="margin">Corruption in an office.</note> bear an Action. But if the diſcourſe be about his dealings as a Vſurer, or as an Executor in the performance of a Truſt committed to him by a Will, there the words will not be actionable. So if two be talking together of Hunting, and one of them confeſſeth that hée doth kill Hares with Engines, and thereupon the other doth ſay to him, <hi>That hee is a Murtherer,</hi> So if <note place="margin">Murder.</note> one ſay of mée; <hi>Hee is a Traitor, for I truſted him to buy Land for mee, and hee bought it for himſelf.</hi> So if hée ſay, <hi>I robbed him, for I took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

               <p n="5">5. But where the ſenſe is double, and indifferent, that it may be taken the one, or the other way. But one of the ſenſes is worſe, and the other is better; there the words ſhall bée taken in the better, and not in the worſer ſenſe. But of this ſée before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That where the ſenſe of the words is general, and may be taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers waies, there it ſhall bée underſtood with reference to the perſon of whom they are ſpoken. For in this the Rule is, <hi>Sermo relatus ad perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam intelligi debet de Conditione perſonae.</hi> And thus the ſame words ſpoken to one man, may be, and ſpoken to another man, may not be actionable. to ſay to a Iudge, or ſuch like Officer, <hi>You are a corrupt man,</hi> is action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But ſuch words to another man are not actionable. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>And yet if in this caſe, there be other words ſpoken together with theſe words, that do manifeſt them not to bée intended with reference to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but to ſome other thing, the words will not be actionable. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Hetleys Rep.</hi> 123. 139.</p>

               <p>THere are ſome words ſpoken that are in ſcandal and diſparagement of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Words that tend to the ſlander of a mans title to his Land; or to a mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheritance.

That in all caſes where an Action will lye for a Slander of this nature there muſt be theſe things in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The words muſt be ſpoken about ſuch Land, as wherein I that am to bring the Action, have ſome Title of Eſtate, or at leaſt a poſſibility, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of Eſtate or Title in Poſſeſſion, Remainder, or Reverſion. For if they bée ſpoken about Land that doth not concern mée, and wherewith I have not to do, they cannot as they refer to the Land be actionable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The words ſpoken muſt be falſe; For if what is ſaid bée true, bée it what it will, the ſpeaker may juſtifie the ſpeaking of it where an Action is brought againſt him for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt be ſpoken by one, that neither hath, nor pretendeth title to the Land himſelf, and that is not of Counſel with him that hath or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth title to it.</p>
               <p>For if a man lay claim to Land that another hath in poſſeſſion, or to which hée doth pretend title, as next heir, or otherwiſe. And hée ſhall ſay any ſuch words as theſe, <hi>That the Land is his Land that claimeth it, and not the others;</hi> or, <hi>that hee hath a good title to it, and the other hath no title to it;</hi> or, <hi>that hee hath ſuch an Eſtate in it;</hi> or, <hi>ſuch a conveyance of it, if in truth hee have ſuch a conveyance of it,</hi> and if it bée true, as hée ſaith, no Action will lye for it. So if they both claim as heir, and the one of them ſay of the other, <hi>That hee is a Baſtard,</hi> or, <hi>that hee is not the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heir;</hi> or, <hi>that his Father was an Alien,</hi> or the like; and that hée himſelf is the heir. And ſo if the Counſel of ſuch a man ſhall uſe any ſuch words as theſe in the agitation of his Caſe about the Lands, theſe words will not be actionable. And yet if a man ſhall pretend title to the Land another hath in poſſeſſion, and hath no colour of title for it. And ſay, hée hath ſuch a déed or conveyance of it, where in truth hée hath no ſuch déed, or conveyance at all; or, if hée hath any ſuch, it is a counterfeit, and a forged one, and hée knoweth it to be ſo; in theſe Caſes the words may be actionable. But if there be any colour for what is ſaid, the words will not be actionable. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 17, 18, <hi>Yelvertons Rep,</hi> 80. 88. <hi>New Book of Entries.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Trin.</hi> 25. <hi>Eliz.

And therefore where a man is not about the ſale of his Land, or about a match with a Wife or Husband, and another ſhall ſpeak words to the diſparagement of the title of his Land; this will not bear an Action.

               <p>But here wée muſt and to the Caſes before put upon this head, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cautions to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That in many of the Caſes before mentioned under this head, the words there mentioned that are ſaid not to be actionable in another Caſe; yet if they be ſpoken to a Iuſtice of Peace, or ſome ſuch like Officer, with reference to his Office, they may be actionable. <hi>Huttons Rep.</hi> 131.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That no <hi>Innuendo</hi> will alter the Caſe, or make the words not action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in themſelves, to be actionable, by the <hi>Innuendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That in ſome of the Caſes before cited (as to the frame of words) not to be actionable, that there perhaps by the help of a ſpecial Averment, added by the Plaintiff in his Declaration, the ſame words may bee made actionable, and therein eſpecially, wherein the Plaintiff ſhall afterwards have a verdict given for him alſo in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That in ſome of the Caſes noted not to be actionable for the frame of the words, the precedent or ſubſequent words ſpoken at the ſame time with them, may make them actionable, for as the precedent and ſubſequent words may make actionable words ſpoken at the ſame time not actionable, ſo may they make words not actionable to be actionable.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That in many Caſes where the words originally ſpoken for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47134:20"/> may not be Actionable, yet after by the help of a Verdict for the Plaintiffe in the Caſe, the Action may become maintainable.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That the Plaintiff muſt be very careful how he Declare in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon any ſuch words ſpoken, and the Defendant likewiſe how he pleads, for either of them may much diſadvantage themſelves thereby.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That many of theſe Caſes ſéem very difficult, and queſtionable, and therefore it will be the wiſdome of him that is to Sue in ſuch a Caſe, to be well adviſed by the Lawyers therein.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall come to the Matter and Quality of the Slander it ſelf, and herein we are to know, what we have before touched upon, That there are ſome Slanders that bring a man in danger of his life, and there are other Slanders that doe not bring a man in danger of his life, but they doe bring him in danger of ſome bodily harm; and there are other Slanders that doe neither bring him in danger of his life, nor of other bodily harm; but they bring him in danger of ſome other damage and prejudice in his Name, or Eſtate, or in both. Thoſe that bring a man in danger of his life, doe carry in them ſome charge, either about matter of Treaſon, or about ſome other Felony; but herein we are to know, that there are ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words that may refer to both, or either of theſe, and may bee Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable words, and therefore it is held, That this Action will lye for ſaying of a man, <hi>Hee is a Traitor, a Murtherer, a Thief, a Robber, a Church-robber,</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47134:22"/> Wée are to know firſt of all, That Treaſon (in the eye of our Law) is a great Crime, and the puniſhment appointed by the Law to be inflicted on him that dath commit this offence, is the loſs of his life, and all his eſtate whatſoever.

               <p>So it is ſaid to lye for this, <hi>Thou art an enemy to the State of this</hi>

               <p>So it will lye for a Maſter, for theſe words ſpoken to his Servant, <hi>Thou haſt a Traitor to thy Maſter.

               <p>So it is held, it will lye for this, <hi>I am perſwaded in my conſcience</hi>

               <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Godb. Rep.</hi> 147. to be adjudged not to lye for theſe words, <note place="margin">Inclination.</note>

               <p>Nor will this Action lye for this, <hi>Thou haſt dealt treacherouſly with mee.</hi> But to ſay, <hi>Thou haſt dealt treacherouſly with the King,</hi> are dangerous words, and may be actionable. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 80. <hi>Yelvertons Rep.</hi> 72.</p>

If any man therefore doe by ſlanderous words charge another with this Crime, or any thing like unto it, he may have his remedy againſt him by this Action.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is held that this Action will lye againſt a man for ſaying of another, <hi>That he is a Murtherer;</hi> Or for ſaying, that <hi>he hath committed</hi>

               <p n="2">2 In all the Caſes before named, and in other Caſes of like nature with the words before mentioned, that are actionable words, the Plaintiff is not bound to ſet forth in his Declaration any ſpecial loſſe hée hath ſuſtained by the words, for the Action is maintainable without it.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

But this is certain, That where the Action is brought for words of import, to charge the Plaintiff with the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a man, it will be the ſure way for the Plaintiff in his Declaration, to ſhew that hée is dead, and was ſo when the words were ſpoken. Or if hée do not ſo, then it will be the wiſdome of the Defendant in his pleading, to ſhew hée is yet alive, or was alive when the words were ſpoken; for then no Action will lye upon them. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 252. <hi>Yelverton.</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. <hi>part laſt publiſht.</hi> 823. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 438. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 1. <hi>part</hi> 42. <hi>Hobb.

To take upon one by Witchcraft, and ſuch like waies, to diſcover any thing loſt, or any treaſure, to provoke to unlawful love, or to deſtroy, or hurt any perſon, cattle, or goods, is a great offence and very penal: If any man therefore ſhall by ſlanderous words, charge another with this Crime, or anything like unto it, hée may have this Action for his remedy. <hi>Stat.</hi> 1. <hi>Jac. chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Coo.</hi> 13. 59.

               <p>Some of the Iudges have from time to time béen of opinion; that this <note place="margin">Witch.</note> Action will lye, for calling of a man or woman Witch; or ſaying, hée, [or ſhée] is a Witch, without the Addition of any other words to it: And ſome Iudgements are ſaid to bée given accordingly. <hi>For which ſee, Croo.</hi> 2. 306. 150. 639. 531. 205. <hi>In Godb. pl.</hi> 435.

               <p>It is ſaid, to be adjudged, to lye for the words in the Caſes hereafter next following.

               <p>AS to Slanderous words that have an Import in them of any matter of Theft; we are to know, that Theft is the unlawful taking away of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans goods from him againſt his will, and this is a great offence and <note place="margin">Theft, what it is.</note> very Penal: For by the greater Felony, which is the ſtealing of any thing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> above Twelve Pence in value, the offender doth in many caſes looſe his

And others, as Trées, Corn, Graſſe, Turnips, Fatches, and the like, growing upon the ground, Apples, Hops, and the like fruit of Trees, the Law doth look upon as incident to, and parcel of the thing wherein they are, and whereon they grow, until they be ſevered, and till then no Felony can be committed by the taking of any ſuch thing away; and therefore the Report of the doing of ſuch a thing is <note place="margin">Felony.</note> not ſo dangerous; but in many of the Caſes it cannot but bee obſerved, there is (at leaſt ſéemingly) much contradiction, the ſumme of all being put together, ſéemes to be thus much. That it is agréed on all ſides, that if the charge in the words be of ſuch a Theft, as if true, may bring a man in peril of his life, or member of his body, as where it doth charge him with the ſtealing of any of theſe things ſevered from that to which it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, the words will be actionable.</p>

               <p>So likewiſe where the charge is thus, <hi>Thou art a Thief, for thou haſt ſtoln my Apples out of my Orchard, or ſtoln my Trees off my ground,</hi> or the like, the words will not be actionable; for a man cannot be in danger of life, or member, by the taking away of theſe things, for it is no Felony to cut and take away ſtanding Corn out of the Field, Apples from the Trées in an Orchard, nor to cut and take away ſtanding Trées, Wood, Furzes, and the like; or to take away the barres or Irons of a Window, Tiles from off the houſe, and the like, and therefore the charge of taking them away is no charge of Felony, or other great Crime.</p>
               <p>But where the words of the Slander are thus. <hi>Thou art a Thief, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Words of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification.</note> 
                  <hi>haſt ſtoln my Apples out of my Orchard,</hi> or the like, upon this Caſe the Iudges have béen divided in their opinions, ſome of them maintaining that the words ſubſequent to the actionable words may bee qualified by the word <hi>[And]</hi> as well as by the the word <hi>[For]</hi> others maintaining that the word [For] only, will enure, and work to explaine and qualifie; and that when the words are brought in by [And] they are, and ſhall bée <hi>cumulative,</hi> and an additional ſlander; as, <hi>Thou art a Thief, and haſt ſtoln my Apples out of my Orchard,</hi> or the like, that in ſuch Caſes the Action ſhall lye for the word <hi>thief</hi> alone, and not be taken away by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words, as in caſe where the words be, <hi>Thou art a Thief, for thou haſt ſtoln my Apples out of my Orchard.</hi> But that it ſhall be alike in both Caſes.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47134:34"/>
               <p> Some of the Iudges alſo have put a difference betwéen words of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation uttered at the ſame time with other words, and words of qualification, delivered at another time; as where one ſhall ſay, <hi>I.

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves men therefore in theſe Caſes, that have néed to know the Law, to take good advice herein.</p>
               <p>It hath béen agréed that this Action will lye for theſe words, <hi>Thou maintaineſt theeves to ſteal my goods, Croo.</hi> 2. 629. So for this, <hi>Thou</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of Words of Slander about Matter of Incontinency.</head>
               <p>AS to this, theſe things are to be known. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 That Slanders are Defamations of this nature being ſaid to be ſpiritual, and properly to be heard and Determined in the Spiritual Court, and there the party grieved by them is to have his relief.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That a charge of Incontinency is notwithſtanding (in the eye of the Common Law) a foul charge, and puniſhable in divers caſes by corporal puniſhment, for if a woman have a Baſtard, ſhée is by this made liable to ſuch puniſhment as the Iudges in diſcretion ſhall inflict, and they alwaies inflict, whipping, impriſonment, or the like.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That generally this Action will not lye for Slanders of this nature, but in Caſes where a man hath, or is like to have ſome ſpecial damage by the ſpeaking of the words. And yet in ſome ſpecial Caſes the Action is given, becauſe it is neceſſarily intended to be a damage to the party of whom they are ſpoken, and that it cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That whiles there was a Law to puniſh more ſeverely Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Baudry, and the like offences, the ſpeaking of words of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might happily be more dangerous than now it is, that this Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. <hi>See Stiles Rep.</hi> 424. 452. 455.</p>
               <p>It hath therefore béen adjudged, reſolved, or ruled by the Iudges. And it is ſaid by them, that this Action will lye for this, <hi>You are a Whore, and have played the whore with ſo many men, you cannot number them.</hi> And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47134:41"/> that Iudgement was given in this Caſe for the Plaintiff without Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Averment.</note> of any ſpecial loſſe by the words. <hi>Stiles Rep.</hi> 328.</p>
               <p>So for this, <hi>This is the Whore that my man C. did beget a Baſtard upon, and ſpent all my money upon, and the Qucan hath been too long in Town for my caſe. Stiles Rep.</hi> 274, 277.</p>
               <p>So it will lye for this ſaid of one about to be married, <hi>Shee is a Whore, and I will maintain it, and I will ſpoil her marriage.</hi> And it was ſaid, it ſhall be actionable, albeit ſhée did not loſe her marriage by it. <hi>Bendloes Rep.</hi> 148. <hi>Godb. Rep.</hi> 273.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid it will lye for this, <hi>Thou art a Whore, and I will prove thee a VVhore, and thou haſt made my houſe a Bawdy-houſe. VVilliams Caſe. B. R. Trin.</hi> 1655.</p>
               <p>So for this ſaid to a woman married, <hi>Thou art a common Baſtard-bearing Whore, and hadſt two Baſtards by a Butcher, and I will prove it. Stiles Rep.</hi> 424.</p>
               <p>So for this ſaid to a Maid, or Woman, <hi>Thou art a Whore, and haſt had a Baſtard;</hi> or to a man, <hi>Thou art a Whore-maſter, and haſt had a baſtard. Bulſtr.</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 90. And yet there in his 2. <hi>part</hi> 89. it is ſaid to bée agréed that it will not lye for theſe words, <hi>Thou art a Whore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor for theſe words, <hi>Thou art a Whore-maſter,</hi> or, <hi>thou didſt lye</hi>

                  <hi>with ſuch a woman,</hi> or, <hi>ſuch a man did lye with thee,</hi> except hée have ſome ſpecial damage by the words. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16, 17. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 163. <hi>Mich.</hi> 39. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>So for this, <hi>He hath got Mary Nob with childe, and the childe is his,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Averment.</note>

               <p>So for this ſpoken of a Lady to whom the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was a Suitor, <note place="margin">By report.</note> 
                  <hi>A. hath reported that he had the uſe of her body [Innuendo, that he had carnal Copulation with her] whereas A. did never make any ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Croo.</hi> 2. 162.</p>
               <p>So for this, <hi>She is a VVhore, and I will prove it, and her plying place is in Cheap-ſide, and ſhe gets forty ſhillings a night by playing the whore. Hills Caſe, B. R. Stiles Rep.</hi> 394. but it ſéems it was for the laſt words.</p>
               <p>So for this, ſaid of a Baſtard childe whereof <hi>A. B.</hi> was delivered, <hi>Hee, [Innuendo the Plaintiff] is the reputed Father of the Baſtard. Innuendo</hi>

               <p>So for this, <hi>Thou art a VVhore-maſter, and haſt laine with Browns Wife, and hadſt to doe with her againſt a chair;</hi> if thereby hee loſe his marriage, &amp;c. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 323.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to be adjudged to lye for this, <hi>My VVife is a VVhore, and ſhe was naught with VV. S. [Innuendo the Plaintiffe] and had I had a</hi>

               <p>So for this, where a rumour is abroad of a Baſtard drowned, for this, <hi>I doe verily beleeve the baſtard child was thine;</hi> and this Action was laid <note place="margin">Averment.</note> without any Averment that there was ſuch a Baſtard; and if there were none ſuch, let the Defendant plead it, and ſave himſelf. <hi>Stiles Rep.</hi> 221.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that this Action will not lye for this, <hi>Thou art a VVhore, and I.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of words Spiritual, Paſſionate, and Vain, for which no Action is given.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome other words, that have an import in them of Infamy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> and diſcredit, but are ſaid to be of a ſpiritual nature, and not under the Conuſance of the Common, but of the Civil Law. And there are other words that are ſaid to be only paſſionate, vain, and empty words, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which the Law gives no Action.</p>
               <p>It is held therefore, that to call one <hi>Baſtard, Whore, Whoremaſter,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Spiritual Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> 
                  <hi>Advowterer, Fornicator,</hi> and the like, theſe Slanders (if any be in them) are méerly ſpiritual, and are properly examinable and determinable in the Eccleſiaſtical Court. And therefore the Common Law doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with them, but in Caſes where they are intermingled with ſome temporal damage occaſioned by them to any man; in which Caſes the Law <note place="margin">Averment.</note> doth give him repair for his damage only by this Action. And therefore the Plaintiff in ſuch Actions is alwaies to make in his Suit brought a ſpecial Averment of his damage. Otherwiſe the Temporal Courts have no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſance of the Cauſe. For this <hi>ſee chap.</hi> 14, And therefore no Action will lye in any of our Temporal Courts, for any charge of Incontinency (as a Defamation only) for calling of one <hi>Whoremaſter,</hi> or <hi>Whore,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>that one was naught with another, that hee or ſhee hath had children by another man, or by another mans wife,</hi> or the like. But for this, hée is to have his remedy in the Spiritual Court.</p>
               <p>So if one man call another <hi>Heretick, Schiſmatick, Baſtard, Miſcreant,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heretick. Schiſmatick. Miſcreant. Advowterer.

It hath béen therefore adjudged, that this Action will not lye for ſaying, <hi>that hee had two Baſtards, and ſhould have kept them;</hi> and that by reaſon thereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord did ariſe betwéen him and his wife, and they were like to have béen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 473. <hi>And</hi> 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 14. 17. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 16. 17. 20. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 163. 473. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 2. 89. 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Noys Rep.</hi> 85. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. 107. 186. <hi>Goldsb.</hi> 36. <hi>Hobb.

               <p>The words that follow are light and trivial, or haſty and paſſionate words; And therefore (as wée have ſhewed before) they give no Action, as for any of theſe words, <hi>Villain, Rogue, Knave, Baſtard, Varlet, Cheater, Couzener, Railer, Liar, Miſcreant, Vermine, Hypocrite,</hi> and the like; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in caſe where ſome ſpecial damage comes thereby to the party of whom the words are ſpoken.

               <p>And theſe following words are looked upon as trivial words, for which no <note place="margin">Vermine. Falſe Brother. Rogue.</note> Action<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of an Action of the Caſe for a Conſpiracy.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Conſpiracy (ſtrictly taken) is where two or more perſons do purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and maliciouſly, conſpire and labour together falſly, and unjuſtly, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>What it is Sect.</hi> 1.</note> without any ground at all, to indict another for ſome Treaſon, Felony, or other offence; and after hée which is ſo Indicted, is upon that Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after a lawful tryal, purged and acquitted; in this Caſe, and for this wrong, as hee may have other remedy, ſo hee may have remedy by an Action of the Caſe, wherein the Plaintiff ſhall recover damages accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his harm. <hi>Coo.</hi> 9. 56. <hi>F.

               <p>The word Conſpiracy, and the writ of Conſpiracy, is ſometimes taken more largely (to wit) for any agréement, or combination betwéen others, to vex and moleſt mée in any vexations Suit whatſoever; in which Caſe the Law gives mée a remedy by this Action, to which wee may happily ſay more hereafter.</p>

               <p>And this Action is given to the party indicted, as well for the ſcandal that both grow to him thereby, as for the trouble which may befal him, by reaſon of the preferring of the Bill of Indictment againſt him. <hi>Stiles Rep.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Croo.</hi> 1. <hi>part laſt publiſht</hi> 564. 724. 725.</p>
               <p>But for the opening of this point, theſe things are to bee known, that in all Caſes where this Writ of Conſpiracy ſhall bée maintainable, there muſt bee theſe things in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This lyeth as well upon an Indictment for Treaſon, as upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment for Felony; and other matters. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 271. 272.</p>
               <p>But it will not lye for an Indictment of Treſpas. <hi>Stiles Rep.</hi> 157. 424.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There muſt bee two or more in the Plot, for the Writ of Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will not lye againſt one man alone, nor againſt a man and his wife (who are but one perſon in Law) unleſs the Writ ſay that they <hi>Simulcum</hi>

And hence it is that if the Suit be begun againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all but one of them are diſcharged of it to all intents, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquit by verdict, hereby hee is diſcharged alſo. <hi>F.

               <p>But if the Writ bee brought againſt two, and one of them doth barr the Plaintiff by a Demurre in Law, or one doth appear and plead, and his plea is found againſt him: in theſe Caſes the other is not diſcharged but the Plaintiff ſhall recover, though the other be not attainted: And yet in this Caſe hee may perhaps refuſe to anſwer without the other; Or if all the Conſpirators but one bee dead; there the Writ may bee had againſt him alone. <hi>F.

               <p n="3">3 The party that brings this Writ of Conſpiracy, muſt be indicted, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47134:58"/> and acquitted, for a purpoſe, or intent without the Act, (however in ſome caſes it was puniſhable in the <hi>Starre-Chamber)</hi> yet it is not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by our Law. And therefore this Action will not lye for a Plot, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, without an execution of it. <hi>Non officit conatus, niſi ſequatur ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus. Coo.</hi> 9. 56. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 114.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The proceeding, and proſecution in queſtion, muſt be voluntary, and not compulſory. And therefore neither this Action, nor an Action of the Caſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> in general, will lye againſt a man that doth proſecute another upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment by conſtraint, or compulſion in a Court, as where men are obliged to it by their Oath, or Office, as Iuſtices of Peace, or Iurors, ſworn to preſent ſuch offences, or witneſſes called to teſtifie their knowledge of ſuch things; or one that doth come into a Court voluntarily, and there diſcover one that is a Felon indeed; and yet if it be voluntary at the firſt, and after compulſory, it may be unlawful and actionable.</p>
               <p>And yet if one ſhall come into a Court voluntarily, and diſcover Felonies, and it be true, which hee doth diſcover, and this be without any malice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, no Action will lye for this. So, if one come into a Court, and by the command of all, or one of the Iuſtices, draw, or procure to be drawn an Indictment; or if, being bound to proſecute, hee do ſo, and cauſe an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. Or if hee be bound to give in evidence, and hee do ſo; or hee do give falſe evidence, this will not make him liable to this Action. 27. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 12. 35. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Fitz.</hi> 115. <hi>Leonard Rep.</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>For if this Writ ſhould lye againſt one that comes in, only to ſwear to the truth of an Indictment, then would no man come in to do it. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 1. <hi>part</hi> 185. <hi>Porter and Griffins Caſe. B. R.</hi>

And if a Witneſſe, or Iuror had conſpired out of Court, and the Witneſſe had ſworn, or the Iuror had given a corrupt verdict, upon a Conſpiracy before out of Court, they might have been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Starr-Chamber.

               <p>And yet, if there be juſt cauſe, as that in truth there is a Felony commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and any man whatſoever, ſhall complain to a Iuſtice of Peace of it, and thereupon, hée that doth complain, is bound over to proſecute (which is the ordinary courſe) and thereupon hée doth prefer an Indictment, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, &amp;c. this is not actionable. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 32. 130. 191. <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 1. <hi>part</hi> 150.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The procéeding, and proſecution muſt be malicious, for an unjuſt revenge, as well as voluntary.

And yet it is not néedful in this Caſe, that there be ſo much done, as there muſt be in the Writ of Conſpiracy. For in this caſe, if one do but procure another to be arreſted, brought before Iuſtices, examined, or impriſoned for a Felony, and hée be never indicted for the Felony; it ſéems that for this only without more, this Action will lye in this Caſe. <hi>Coo.</hi> 9. 56. 57. <hi>Coo.</hi> 4. 14. 15. <hi>F.

                     <hi>it is well known that I am a true Subject, but thou (Innuendo,</hi> the ſaid Servant) <hi>ſerveſt no true Subject, and thine own conſcience may accuſe thee thereof.</hi> It was moved in arreſt of Iudgement, that theſe words are not actionable, for no ſlander comes to the Plaintiff thereby; for perhaps the party ſerved no man, but the Quéen, and if the words may receive ſuch ſenſe, which is no pregnant proof of Infamy, they are not action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Savage</hi> and <hi>Cook.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>Thou art not the Queens friend,</hi> are not actionable, for it might be they were <note place="margin">Words incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as to the perſon ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> ſpoken in reſpect of ſome ordinary miſ-demeanours, as in not payment of ſubſidies, or the like: Alſo it is not averted, that the party to whom the words ſpoken, was the Plaintiffs Servant. <hi>Cook,</hi> where a man is touched in the duty of his office, or in the courſe of life, an Action lyeth, although that otherwiſe the words are not actionable, and here is ſet forth in the Declaration. That the Plaintiff at the time of ſpeaking of the ſaid words, was a Iuſtice of Peace, and Sheriff of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Captain of a Troop of a hundred and twenty horſe, to attend the preſervation of the Quéens perſon: So in reſpect of place and dignity in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as 2. <hi>H.</hi> 8.

                     <hi>VVarrants,</hi> without ſaying, they were falſified by him, adjudged an Action did not lye, <hi>VVray Chief Juſtice.</hi> Theſe words in themſelves are not actionable, for the Plaintiff might be untrue in ſmall things, which gave no diſcredit, but the quality of the perſon of whom they were ſpoken, may add weight to them, as to call one Bankerupt generally, <note place="margin">Bankerupt</note> no Action lyeth upon it, but to call a Merchant ſo, is actionable. So to call one Papiſt, no Action lyeth for it; but if one calls the Arch-Biſhop <note place="margin">Papiſt.</note> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in, an Action will lye, for hee is Governour of the Church. <hi>Thou art an untrue man to the Queen,</hi> gives not an Action to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <note place="margin">Untrue man to the King.</note> Subject, but ſuch words ſpoken of one of the Privy Council, are actionable. <hi>Corrupt man,</hi> of themſelves are not actionable, but being ſpoken of a Iudge, an Action Iyeth.</p>

But the opinion of the Court was, that the words ſhall be taken in the worſe ſenſe, according to his intent which hée ſpake, when hée ſaid it to be a good Leaſe. And the words themſelves imply, that hée ſpake them to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Title of a ſtranger, which is not lawful; and now hée cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf by intituling of himſelf, when at the firſt the words did not import as much, and now hée cometh too late to juſtifie. <hi>Croo.</hi> 2. 163.</p>
